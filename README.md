# pump-probe-imaging-multishot
The gui makes images in pump probe regime, i.e. it moves delay line (NewPort XPS controller), makes reference image (no pump) with MicroManager core, opens shutter (using lock-in SR830), makes pumped image. Program saves .dat files and .png screenshots

Tested with Teledyne Retiga R3 camera on Win10 (Win7 didn't take images with mmcore, with no reason)
